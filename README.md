## Step 3: insert the key in the computer

## Step 4: boot on the USB key
- 2 ways to access the [BIOS menu](https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/fr-fr/000126121/acc%c3%a8s-%c3%a0-la-configuration-syst%c3%a8me-uefi-bios-sous-windows-sur-votre-syst%c3%a8me-dell#:~:text=Appuyez%20sur%20la%20touche%20F2%3E%20sur%20l'%C3%A9cran%20du%20logo,pendant%20le%20d%C3%A9marrage%20du%20syst%C3%A8me)
- When you are inside the menu, you must go to the boot tab and put the USB device in the first line then apply changes and exit the menu, Restart the computer.

## Step 5: install the OS selecting "minimal" install
You must be connected to the internet to access the box launcher interaction

## Users
when you will connect, your user that you have created does not exist (known bug), you will have two default users, for local admin the password is localadmin and for local user the password is localuser

## Bug case
If the interaction box blocks you in the menus and you need to exit, turn on the computer, get out of the standby mode and go to the user menu, then restart the computer
